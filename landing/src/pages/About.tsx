      Hey there! I'm Bless, I love turning ideas into lines of code. I live for
      that "Aha!" moment when everything just clicks.
      <br />
      <br />
      I graduated from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, majoring
      in Information Technology. Since then, I've been fascinated into web
      development.
      <br />
      <br />
      At Media Meter, Inc., I whip up cool interfaces and make them work like a
      charm using ReactJS, Typescript, Vite, TailwindCSS, and other tools. My
      time here significantly developed not just my technical skills but also my
      leadership abilities, particularly through spearheading numerous front-end
      projects. But before that, I contributed to the online presence of a big
      US eCommerce platform as a Content Specialist at Insight Direct
      Philippines for almost 5 years.

      As a coworker, I am known for making the room sparkle with good vibes,
      you'll rarely catch me without a smile. I like inviting colleagues for a
      quick snack at the pantry or to have a coffee break. Although I might
      appear a bit shy initially, once I'm comfortable, I bring a cool and
      easygoing vibe.
      <br />
      <br />
      Beyond the tech stuff, I'm always ready to lend a helping hand and eager
      to assist my colleagues in any way possible. Teamwork is not just a word
      for me; it's a spirit I embrace wholeheartedly. I believe on teamwork,
      problem-solving, and that awesome feeling when a tricky code finally
      works.
      <br />
      <br />
      When I'm not coding, you might catch me hiking mountains or maybe, just
      sleeping.
      <br />
      <br />
      Let's team up and create something amazing together! ðŸš€
