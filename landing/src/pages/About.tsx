      Hey there! I'm Bless, I love turning ideas into lines of code. I live for
      that "Aha!" moment when everything just clicks.
      <br />
      <br />
      I graduated from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, majoring
      in Information Technology. Since then, I've been fascinated into the wild
      world of web development.
      <br />
      <br />
      At Media Meter, Inc., I whip up cool interfaces and make them work like a
      charm using ReactJS, Typescript, Vite, TailwindCSS, and other tools. My
      time here significantly developed not just my technical skills but also my
      leadership abilities, particularly through spearheading numerous front-end
      projects.
      <br />
      <br />
      Before that, I contributed to the online presence of a big US eCommerce
      platform as a Content Specialist at Insight Direct Philippines for almost
      5 years.
      <br />
      <br />
      Beyond the tech stuff, I'm big on teamwork, problem-solving, and that
      awesome feeling when a tricky code finally works. When I'm not coding, you
      might catch me hiking mountains or in a beach. Let's team up and create
      something amazing together! ðŸš€
